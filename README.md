### Introduction
The motivation for this project was to take the NBeats model architecture defined in the original paper here:  https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10437 and reproduce it in a widely accessible form in keras.  In the past few years this model has become very popular as a timer series forecasting tool, but its implementation in keras seemed elusive, without an easy-to-use, well documented option online that'd be simple for newcomers to try. When you are looking to use a new tool for the first time, it's vital that you can do a simple install and quickly use an api syntax you are already familiar with to get started within minutes.  

To that end, KerasBeats was built with the following ideas in mind:
 - It should reflect the original model architecture as closely as possible.
 - It should have a simple, high level architecture that allows people to get started as quickly as possible using the familar `fit/predict` methods that everyone is already familiar with
 - It should allow you to quickly and easily use it as a keras model to take advantage of the libraries existing functionality and enable its use in existing workflows
